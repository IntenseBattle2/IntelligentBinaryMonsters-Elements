Description: </br>
Since the world's creation, life has grown and evolved on planet Earth, seperated into two groups. Plants: stationary, silent, and beautiful, grew everywhere on Earth's surface, feeding off the remains of dead animals and undoing work of destruction. Animals: free, strong, and cunning, shaped Earth's surface and its ecosystem. For eons, this is how the world worked, until... </br>
A specific species of animals, referred to as humans, became too powerful and started destroying the earth beyond repair. When just about all seemed lost, one particular human had a plan. He went into a laboratory, a special room used by scientists of the olden days, and created a brand new version of life: part animal, part plant, and part machine. They became known as the Intelligent Binary Monsters, or IBMon; special creatures designed to save Earth and keep it stable. And the aforementioned human became known as The Creator.
